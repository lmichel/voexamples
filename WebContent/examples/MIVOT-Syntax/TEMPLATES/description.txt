This example illustrates the use the TEMPLATE mapping block .
This element lists the data model classes with their attributes, that correspond to the columns content in a <TABLE> VOTable element. 

Usually each table column corresponds to some class's attribute represented by an <ATTRIBUTE> element. 
For instance 'lon' and 'lat' are attributes of LongLatPoint of the Coords data model.
The Class is represented by an <INSTANCE> and gathers its <ATTRIBUTE> elements as well as some <REFERENCE>  to the Coordinate system.

The TEMPLATE definition applies to all rows of the table and builds objects from the columns it refers to.

The classes represented in the mapping block, can be effectively translated further to an Astropy class or 
some other dedicated object in the astronomical libraries.

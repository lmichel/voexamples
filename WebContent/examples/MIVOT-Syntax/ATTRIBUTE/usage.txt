1. Child of INSTANCE
    The ATTRIBUTE can be seen as a class attribute;
    it must have a @dmrole XML attribute.
    In this case, the ATTRIBUTE must be specified by:
        * @ref - reference to a VOTable PARAM or FIELD
        * @value - a literal
        * if both are provided; @value serves as the default
        if the reference cannot be resolved
        * if @ref cannot resolved and there is no @value,
        the client must consider that value as NULL in its software context (language, inner model).

2. Child of COLLECTION
    In this case the host COLLECTION can be seen as a vector
    and the ATTRIBUTE as one coordinate of the vector.
    It must have no @dmrole XML attribute or an empty one.
    In this case, the ATTRIBUTE must be specified by:
        * @ref - reference to a VOTable PARAM or FIELD
        * @value - a literal
        * if both are provided, @value serves as the default if the reference cannot be resolved
        * if @ref cannot resolved and there is no @value,
        the client must consider that value as NULL.
        The definition of the NULL value depends of the software environment

3. Any case :
    The ATTRIBUTE must always have a non-empty @dmtype XML attribute.
    This @dmtype may complete missing types in the VOTable.
    In case of inconsistency with VOTable @dmtype SHOULD supersede VOTable types.
    An ATTRIBUTE with a @ref pointing on a FIELD must be located in the TEMPLATES
    element mapping the table containing that field.
    @ref of ATTRIBUTE-s located in the GLOBALS block
    can only point at PARAM since the GLOBALS element
    does not map any data table.


Example of ATTRIBUTE set with either a column reference
or a static value ATTRIBUTE[@dmrole=cube:DataAxis.dependent] will
always be set as "False" whereas ATTRIBUTE[@dmrole=coords:MJD.date]
will be set with the value of the IDobstime column:

The PRIMARY_KEY element allows to set an identification key to an INSTANCE.

The primary keys are only used in the context of REFERENCE using FOREIGN_KEY A primary key can be either static or dynamic:
* Static: the key value is given by the @value attribute.
* Dynamic: the key value is given by the value of the field referenced by @ref This pattern is only valid if the INSTANCE is within a TEMPLATES.

The type of the key must always be specified by the @dmtype attribute.

The JOIN element populates a COLLECTION with INSTANCE elements from
another collection, called hereafter the foreign collection. The foreign collection
can either be a static element (COLLECTION child of GLOBALS) or a collection
of INSTANCE elements resulting from the iteration over a TEMPLATES.
The JOIN element must contain XML attributes identifying the foreign
collection like @sourceref and/or @dmref . It can have WHERE children elements
stating the join condition and it must be the unique child of the host
COLLECTION.

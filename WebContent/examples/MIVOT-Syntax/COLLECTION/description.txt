COLLECTION is a container element to be used each time we have to gather
items of the same kind. It is used in different contexts, each allowing a
limited subset of elements for its content. COLLECTION items must all be of
the same type. COLLECTION can be populated either by a static list of items
(INSTANCE, ATTRIBUTE, ..) or by joining to another COLLECTION by using the
JOIN statement.

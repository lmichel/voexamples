The typical required classes corresponding to columns found in this table have a matching concept in the Astronomical Measurement Data Model (MEAS) which are: 
- Position 
- Velocity 
- Time
- Label

The MANGO data model allows to bind these properties to a MANGO Source object.
To workout the mapping the snippet generator can be called 
1) for each individual classes 
    The mapping elements are then gathered manually in a collection of Properties.
2) with a list of MANGO classes that are bound as a collection to a Source Object 

NB : 2 requires the user to be familiar to the MANGO, and MEAS data model. that mimic the sequence of to bind

This example illustrates how to handle a Source catalog table and map data model classes on it.
Here we consider a list of sources, for which measures are recorded and gathered in a row.

The example here is an exercpt from the The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC), Release 2.0 (Evans+, 2019). 
It shows only a selection of columns to illustrate the classes used for Position, Error, Flux, etc.

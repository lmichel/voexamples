Show me a list of all data that satisfies:
    I. DataType=Image
   II. Spatial resolution better than 0.3 arc seconds
  III. Filter = J or H or K
   IV. RA between 16 hours and 17 hours
    V. DEC between 10 degrees and 11 degrees
    
Such a query needs to compute RA in degrees, extract information from Filter and adjust spectral intervals for search.

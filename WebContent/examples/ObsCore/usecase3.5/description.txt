Show me a list of all data that satisfies:
    I. DataType=Cube with 4 dimensions
   II. Axes includes FREQ
  III. Spatial axes contain more than  100 pixels
   IV. freq range > 500MHz
    V. Rest Frequency = 345.795990 GHz appears in band

-- 500 MHz = 0.599585 meters
-- 345.795990GHz = 8.669634948629682E-4 meters
-- assuming the observation is ~square, 100x100 ~ area/s_resolution^2 >= 100
-- converting from observed to rest freq requires target_redshift or an assumed redshift
-- we just use observed, eg assume z=0

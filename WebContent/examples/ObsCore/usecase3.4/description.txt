Show me a list of all data that satisfies:
    I. DataType=Cube with 4 dimensions
   II. Axes includes FREQ
  III. Spatial axes contain more than  100 pixels
   IV. Axes includes STOKES
    V. Frequency resolution < 1 MHz
   VI. Rest Frequency = 345.795990 GHz appears in band

NB: Need for a polarisation axis

-- 345.795990GHz = 8.669634948629682E-4 meters

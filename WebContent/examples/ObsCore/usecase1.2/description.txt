Let me input a list of RA and DEC coordinates and show me spatially coincident observations satisfying:
    I. Imaging or spectroscopy data
   II. Includes one or more of the RA,DEC values in the list (LIST=SERVICE REQ)
  III. Includes both a wavelength in the range 5000-9000 angstroms AND an X-ray image (AND=SERVICE REQ)
  
This use case may need several steps to select images from X-RAY domain, select image and spectra on optical domain and compute the overlap.

It requires two functionalities from the service: 
LIST=SERVICE REQ, to query on lists of positions given as input (UPLOAD capability)
AND=SERVICE REQ, to compute the intersection between two response lists.

Show me a list of all data that satisfies:
    I. DataType=Spectrum
   II. Energy spans 1 to 5 keV
  III. Total counts in spectrum > 100
   IV. Exposure time > 10000 seconds
    V. Data Quality: Fully Calibrated
   
-- 1 keV = 1.2398545639349092E-9 m
-- 5 keV = 2.4797091278698184E-10 m

-- we cannot find which observations have the total counts,
-- but we can order by ~depth within the collection

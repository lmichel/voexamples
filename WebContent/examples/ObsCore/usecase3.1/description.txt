Show me a list of data with:
    I. DataType=cube (IFU spectroscopy?)
   II. RA,DEC includes value RA1,DEC1
  III. Field size > 100 square arcseconds
   IV. DataSensitivity = deep
    V. Spectral resolution better than 5 angstroms FWHM
    
-- we cannot find which observations have the queried depth, but we can
-- group the results by which telescope/instrument they came from and
-- order the results in decreasing depth within each group

-- assume 100 sq arcmin ~ 0.028 sq deg

This use-case is added in ObsCore 1.1 to search for time series against the number of time slots and be sure to have enough samples along the time axis

Show me a list of all data which satisfies:
    I. DataType=TimeSeries
   II. RA includes 16.00 hours
  III. DEC includes +41.00
   IV. Time resolution better than 1 minute
    V. Time interval (start of series to end of series) > 1 day
    VI. Number of time slots > 50

Show me a list of all data that satisfies:
    I. DataType=cube with 3 dimensions
   II. Axes includes Velocity		
  III. Axes includes RA
   IV. Axes includes DEC
    V. Velocity Resolution better than 50 km/s
   VI. RA includes 16.000
  VII. Dec includes +41.000
  
 NB: in this case optional data model fields related to redshift axis can be used using   em_ucd=spect.DopplerVeloc, for instance.
 
-- velocity axes not detectable
-- convert from velocity resolution to em_res_power not feasible

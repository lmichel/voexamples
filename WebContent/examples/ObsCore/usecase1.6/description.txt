For an input list of RA, DEC, Modified Julian Date (MJD), show me all data that satisfies (LIST=SERVICE REQ)
   I. DataType=imaging
  II. RA,DEC include the value of  the list and Observation date is within 1 day of the MJD value
  
-- data type = image
-- RA,DEC from an uploaded list
-- observation taken within 1 day of (uploaded) MJD value

-- input.xml: columns ra, dec (ICRS), and mjd, maybe other stuff
-- or use one of these canned input files
-- UPLOAD=input,http://www.cadc.hia.nrc.gc.ca/cvo/ObsCore/UseCase-1.6-input.xml  

There 2 alternatives to constrain the time interval
-- i.mjd BETWEEN (t_min - 1.0) AND (t_max + 1.0)
or
-- t-min - 1.0 <= i.mjd AND i.mjd <= t_max + 1.0
